Due to its amorphous nature, the Chief Of Staff role is often poorly understood and difficult to define. Before becoming one myself, I had little appreciation for the role beyond watching fictional characters like Leo McGarry and Josh Lyman on the West Wing.[^4] As I’ve been settling into this new-to-me role, I’ve been taking notes and thinking critically about what a corporate Chief of Staff does day-to-day, and how they uniquely bring value to their organization and to their principal or executive ("CXO"[^1]). 

At a high level, I'd break down a Chief of Staff's responsibilities into three key parts:

1. **Tactical** - Program management, execution, and operations 
2. **Strategic** - Stewardship of strategy, planning, vision, and culture
3. **“Everything else”** - Serving as advisor, confident, broker, and generally doing what needs to be done

Adding to the confusion, the Chief of Staff function is unique in that the scope, responsibility, and impact can grow dramatically over time from the tactical to the strategic based on the maturity of the organization they support and the seniority of the individual in a role. Whether you're considering the role yourself or are working with a Chief of Staff for the first time, in order from most tactical/junior/immature to most strategic/senior/mature, here are the six things a great Chief of Staff does:

### 1. Manage the office of the CXO

At the most basic level, the Chief of Staff is responsible for managing the "office of the CXO". At GitHub, my team fittingly refers to this as the organizational “operating system”, which the Chief is responsible for installing, configuring, monitoring, upgrading, and patching to keep everything running bug free. In this way, the chief's "software", and by extension, the chief themselves help the business operate more efficiently by scaling the efforts of its leaders and membership. The specific activities will vary depending on the business unit the Chief is supporting, but generally, one would expect this meta work[^2] to include managing:

* **"Rhythm of the business"** - Establishing, documenting, and maturing repeatable processes for critical functions that occur on a regular cadence like budget planning, strategic planning, headcount planning, and the overall planning and execution tempo of the organization.
* **Office operations** - Partnering with human resources, talent acquisition, procurement, and legal among other teams to support the organization's smooth functioning. This may also include being responsible for things like diversity, engagement, or morale initiatives, as well "owning" contracts, vendor agreements, and purchase renewals that don't naturally fit into the other functions.
* **Internal, external, and executive communications** - Reporting for leadership or board reviews; running monthly all hands, lunch and learns, demo days, and other team touch points; preparing the CXO for conferences, events, interviews, presentations, and other engagements; compiling regular updates on business activities; and managing the overall "front door" of the organization to the rest of the company through documentation, process, and other established (and thanks to the Chief, streamlined) interfaces.
* **CXO effectiveness** - Serving as a formal and informal gatekeeper to ensure that the CXO is spending their time on the right things. The Chief has the sense to know what to keep "front of mind" for the CXO, and what falls into "I'll let you know if you need to get involved" territory. When a Chief brings something to the CXO, they know that it's important.
* **Leadership team effectiveness** - Improving the effectiveness of CXO's direct reports (the Chief's peers). This may involve everything from preparing meeting agendas and planning team off sites to establishing communication patterns and cadence to fostering better interpersonal dynamics. 

As a CXO's office matures, this may begin as an office of one (the Chief), but can quickly grow to three or more individuals, whom the Chief is expected to manage to extend their own reach and impact.

### 2. Boundaryless engagement

One of the most powerful organizational "hacks" Chiefs of Staff enjoy is that their scope is organization-wide, meaning the Chief can go to where the work is, regardless of organizational boundaries or corporate hierarchy. This often takes the form of escalation-driven initiative management, but also could involve "important but not urgent" problems that have no clear leader or are otherwise under resourced.

In this capacity, you can think of the Chief of Staff as being the directly responsible individual (DRI) for "somebody should own this"-type projects, ambiguous and broad-reaching problems that require "connecting the dots" to uncover true possibilities, complex organizational change management, and generally doing what needs to be done without regard for title or stated responsibility.

This aspect of the role also can take the form of organizational "air traffic controller", in terms of helping the CXO prioritize projects; resolve disputes, ambiguity, or otherwise driving consensus; and serving as an honest broker by facilitating tough conversations, all to ensure that organizational planes take off and land on time and without incident, regardless of their origin, destination, or flight path.

### 3. Portfolio management

In some ways, you can think of a Chief of Staff as a staff or principle program manager, and for many (such as myself), that's a natural place to transition into the role from. However, as a Chief of Staff, instead of managing one or more well-defined programs, you manage the CXO's entire portfolio of responsibilities. I've [written before](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/) about the ways program managers bring value to an organization, but there are a few I'd specifically call out as uniquely applicable to Chiefs:

* **[Communication, coordination, and facilitation](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#1-communication-coordination-and-facilitation)** - *Communicating* decisions and other key updates that may affect others (especially when not immediately obvious), *coordinating* dependencies and other inter-related efforts across teams (especially when priorities conflict), and *facilitating* work by ensuring teams have the resources they need (especially unblocking through diplomacy and deconfliction).
* **[Reporting up and across](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#4-reporting-up-and-across)** - Establishing, operating, and improving the systems that capture, track, and regularly report on work in flight, especially strategic or other cross-functional initiative, to ensure situational awareness at all levels.
* **[Identify, analyze, and mitigate risk](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#3-identify-analyze-and-mitigate-program-risk)** - The Chief of Staff is the one with their "hands inside of the organizational machine" to identify "squishiness", bring problem areas to light, drive successful execution, and enable teams to consistently ship with speed and confidence.

### 4. Strategy, planning, culture, and values

As a Chief of Staff transitions from the more tactical to the more strategic, they play an increasing role in shaping the organization's vision, 3/5/10 year plans, OKRs, and other far-reaching strategy documents. At the most basic level, that means working with other leaders to establish, document, and communicate planning materials and to drive the execution rhythm for teams to make progress against those strategic goals.

More broadly, this aspect of the role is about helping leaders carry out the CXO's vision and strategic intent at all levels. You can think of this as where policy and politics come together. Once defined, the Chief of Staff is responsible for communicating the organization's plans by distilling and cascading those core strategic tenants to both internal and external stakeholders where they can eventually be realized.

Finally, a Chief of Staff should play a key role in establishing, shaping, debugging, and socializing, organizational culture, values, taste, and behavioral expectations. These are the underlying assumptions that an organization's members fall back on as they resolve ambiguity in pursuit of the organization’s mission. Explicitly and implicitly, Chiefs should set the tone for how the organization prefers to interact, resolve disputes, execute, provide feedback, and solve problems among countless other often invisible decisions that over time can make or break an organization's success.

### 5. Advisor and confidant

As a healthy relationship develops between Chief of Staff and CXO, a more senior Chief begins to serve as a as trusted, strategic advisor and counsel to the CXO by acting as a sounding board as well as second set of eyes, ears, and hands. Specifically:

* **Ear to the ground** - The Chief can always be relied on to understand the pulse of the organization in a way the CXO will never be able to by establishing a "you can talk to me" reputation that invites honest dialog. This often takes the form of maintaining trust-based relationships that create the space for frequent feedback, holding regular 1:1s throughout the organization, and elevating questions that otherwise might not be asked of the CXO or the leadership team.[^3]
* **Deep understanding** - The Chief uses cross-functional knowledge to "scrub in" and deeply understand issues, trends, and perspectives that the CXO may not otherwise have the time to explore in depth. This requires a Chief that thrives in navigating ambiguity through curiosity and research and one that delivers data-driven, and ultimately persuasive recommendations that brings clarity to goals and renders project execution more efficient. This is not too dissimilar from the role an architect or principle engineer might play within engineering, but for business decisions of the same level of complexity, breadth, and impact.[^5] 
* **Proxy** - A more senior Chief is distinct in that a core responsibility is to serve as implicit or explicit deputy CXO, to attend meetings on behalf of the CXO and speak as their representative. This is so common, in fact, that it's often prudent to clarify when you are speaking on your own behalf and when you are acting as the CXO's stand in. This is one of the many ways the Chief becomes a force multiplier for the CXO, allowing them to be in multiple places at once, at least via proxy. With time, strong Chiefs should also feel comfortable making difficult decisions to advance the business, even in the CXO's absence.

### 6. Relationship and brand management

TOO MUCH BIZSPEAK

Exceptional Chiefs of Staff offer transparency, predictability, consistency, and clarity to both those they work with as well as those the CXO work with to establish and grow stronger relationships and be seen as a critical partner. At its core, this is about avoiding surprises by managing expectations between the CXO, the CXO's peers, and other stakeholders. Beyond that, it's about ongoing relationship and brand management to enable the CXO's success by expanding their sphere of influence.

This aspect of the role is the classic leadership through persuasion and influence that relies on knowing who to ask, ____, and maintaining an all around get-stuff-done reputation that makes others trust and want to work with you.

### Conclusion

As I first began settling in, I struggle to get a sense of what a Chief of Staff's typical day looked like (spoiler: there isn't one) or what skills I should be focusing on day-to-day to maximize the value I brought to the principal or executive and to my team. Here’s the list I wish I had as I was first stepping into the role, and I hope it helps others as they do the same and those they work with to better understand the role of a Chief of Staff.
