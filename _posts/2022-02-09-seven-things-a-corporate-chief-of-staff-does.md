title: Seven things a corporate Chief of Staff does
description:
---

Due to its amorphous nature, the Chief Of Staff role is often poorly understood and difficult to define succinctly. Before becoming one myself, I had little understanding of the role or its value beyond watching fictional characters like Leo McGarry and Josh Lyman on the West Wing and a few arms-length interactions with non-fictional congressional and agency Chiefs of Staff from my time in government. 

As I’ve been settling into this new-to-me role, I’ve been taking notes and critically thinking about what a (Corporate) Chief of Staff ("CoS") does day-to-day, and how they uniquely bring value to an organization and to their principal or executive ("CXO"[^1]). At a high level, I'd break down a Chief of Staff's responsibilities into three key parts:

1. **Tactical** - Program management, execution, and operations 
2. **Strategic** - Stewarding strategy, planning, vision, and culture
3. **“Everything else”** - Serving as advisor, proxy, confident, broker, and generally doing whatever needs to be done

Adding to the confusion, the Chief of Staff role is unique in that the scope, responsibility, and impact can grow dramatically over time from the practical to the strategic based on the maturity of the organization and the seniority of the individual in a role. In order from most tactical/junior to most strategic/senior, here are the seven things successful Chiefs of Staff do:

### 1. Manage the office of the CXO

At the most basic level, a Chief of Staff is responsible for managing the office of the CXO. At GitHub, we fittingly refer to this as the organizational “operating system”, which Chiefs are responsible for installing, configuring, monitoring, upgrading, and patching to keep everything running smoothly and to help scale and operate the bushiness more efficiently. The specific activities will vary depending on the function the Chief is supporting, but generally, you would expect this meta work[^2] to include managing:

1. **"Rhythm of the business"** - Establishing, documenting, and maturing repeatable processes for critical functions that occur on a regular cadence like budget planning, strategic planning, headcount planning, and the overall planning and execution tempo of the organization.
2. **Office operations** - Managing human resources, talent acquisition, procurement and legal concerns to support the organization's business objectives. This may also include being responsible for things like diversity or culture initiatives, as well "owning" contracts, vendor agreements, and purchase renewals that don't naturally fit into the other functions.
3. **Internal, external, and executive communications** - Reporting for leadership reviews; organizing meeting agendas, all hands, and team off sites; preparing the CXO for conferences, events, interviews, presentations, and other engagements; preparing regular updates on business activities; and managing the overall "front door" of the organization to the rest of the company through documentation, process, and other established interfaces.
   
### 2. Boundaryless engagement

One of the most powerful organizational "hacks" Chiefs of Staff enjoy is that their scope is organization-wide. This allows the Chief to go to where the work is, regardless of organizational boundaries or corporate hierarchy. This often takes the form of escalation-driven initiative management, but also could involve important but not urgent problems, that have no clear leader or are otherwise are under resourced.

In this capacity, you can think of the Chief of Staff as being the directly responsible individual (DRI) for "somebody should own this" -type projects, ambiguous and broad reaching problems that require "connecting the dots" to uncover possibilities, organizational change management, and generally doing what needs to be done without regard for title or traditional responsibility.

This role also takes the form of organizational "air traffic controller", in terms of helping the CXO prioritize projects; resolving disputes, ambiguity, or otherwise driving consensus; and serving as an honest broker by facilitating tough conversations and the decisions that naturally follow to ensure all planes take off and land on time and without incident.

### 3. Portfolio management

In some ways, you can think of a Chief of Staff as a staff or principle program manager, and for many (such as myself), that's a natural transition. As a Chief of Staff, instead of managing a single program, you manage the CXO's portfolio of responsibilities. I've [written before](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/) about the ways program managers bring value to an organization, but there are a few I'd specifically call out as uniquely applicable to Chiefs:

* **[Communication, coordination, and facilitation](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#1-communication-coordination-and-facilitation)** - *Communicating* decisions and other key updates that may affect others (especially when not immediately obvious), *coordinating* dependencies and other inter-related efforts across teams (especially when priorities conflict), and *facilitating* work by ensuring teams have the resources they need (especially unblocking through diplomacy and deconfliction).
* **[Reporting up and across](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#4-reporting-up-and-across)** - This often involves establishing and operating the systems to capture, track, and regularly report on work in flight, especially strategic or other cross-functional initiative, to ensure situational awareness at all levels.
* **[Identify, analyze, and mitigate risk](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#3-identify-analyze-and-mitigate-program-risk)** - In this sense, I think of the Chief of Staff being the one with their "hands inside of the organizational machine" to identify "squishiness", bring problem areas to light, drive successful execution, and enable teams to consistently ship with speed and confidence.

### 4. Strategy, planning, culture, and values

As a Chief of Staff transitions from the more tactical to the more strategic, they play an increasing role in shaping the organization's vision, N year plans, OKRs, and other far-reaching strategy documents. At the most basic level, that means working with other leaders to establish, document, and communicate planning materials and to drive the execution rhythm for teams to make progress against those strategic goals.

More broadly, this aspect of the role is about helping the staff carry out the CXO's vision and strategic intent at all levels. You can think of this as where policy and politics come together. Once defined, the Chief of Staff is responsible for distilling and cascading those core tenants of organization's strategy to both internal and external stakeholders.

Finally, a Chief of Staff should play a key role in establishing, shaping, debugging, and socializing, organizational culture, values, taste, and behavioral expectations. These are the underlying assumptions that an organization's members fall back on as they resolve ambiguity in pursuit of the organization’s mission. Explicitly and implicitly, Chiefs should set the tone for how the organization prefers to interact, resolve disputes, provide feedback, and solve problems among countless other often invisible decisions.

### 5. Advisor and confidant

As a healthy relationship develops between Chief of Staff and CXO, a more senior Chief begins to serve as a as trusted, strategic advisor and counsel to the CXO by acting as a sounding board and second set of eyes and ears.

* **Gatekeeper** - The Chief serves as a formal and informal gatekeeper to ensure that the CXO is spending their time on the right things that will allow them to have the greatest impact on the organization.
* **Leadership team effectiveness** - The chief manages the effectiveness of CXO's directs, including everything from meeting agendas to cadence and interpersonal dynamics
* **Ear to the ground** - The Chief can always be relied on to understand the pulse of the organization in a way the CXO will never be able to by establishing a "you can talk to me" reputation that invites honest dialog.[^3]
* **Deep understanding** - The Chief uses cross-functional knowledge to "scrub in" and deeply understand issues, trends, and perspectives that the CXO may not have the time to explore.
* **Proxy** - 

### 6. Relationship and brand management

Exceptional Chiefs of Staff offer transparency, predictability, consistency, and clarity to both those they work with and those the CXO work with to establish and grow stronger relationships and be seen as a critical partner. At its core, this is about avoiding surprises by managing expectations between the CXO, the CXO's peers, and other stakeholders. Beyond that, it's about ongoing relationship and brand management to enable the CXO's success by ultimately expanding their sphere of influence.


* Lead through persuasion and influence
* Know who to ask
* GSD reputation

[As a Program Manager](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#5-relationship-management) and now as a Chief Of Staff, I see it is not only acceptable, but an expectation of the job to be able to hear the otherwise unstated.
