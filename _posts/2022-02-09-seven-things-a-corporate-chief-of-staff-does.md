title: Seven things a corporate Chief of Staff does
description:
---

The Chief Of Staff role is often poorly understood and difficult to define succinctly. Before becoming one myself, I had little understanding of the role or its value beyond watching fictional characters like Leo McGarry and Josh Lyman on the West Wing and a few arms-length interactions with non-fictional congressional and agency Chiefs of Staff from my time in government. 

As I’ve been settling into this new role, I’ve been taking notes and critically thinking about what a (Corporate) Chief of Staff ("CoS") does day-to-day, and how they uniquely bring value to an organization and to their principal or executive ("CXO"[^1]). At a high level, I'd break down a Chief of Staff's responsibilities into three parts:

1. **Tactical** - Program management and operations (40%)
2. **Strategic** - Strategy and planning activities (40%)
3. **“Everything else”** - XX (20%)

Adding to the confusion, the Chief of Staff role is unique in that the scope, responsibility, and impact can grow dramatically over time from the practical to the strategic based on the maturity of the organization and the seniority of the individual in a role. In order from most tactical/junior to most strategic/senior, here are the seven things successful Chiefs of Staff do:

### 1. Manage the office of the CXO

At the most basic level, a Chief of Staff is responsible for managing the office of the CXO. At GitHub, we fittingly refer to this as the organizational “operating system”, which Chiefs are responsible for installing, configuring, monitoring, upgrading, and patching to keep everything running smoothly and to help grow, scale, and run the bushiness more efficiently. The specific activities will vary depending on the function the Chief is supporting, but generally, you would expect this meta work[^2] to include managing:

1. **"Rhythm of the business"** - Establish, document, and mature repeatable processes for critical "rhythm of the business" functions like budget planning, strategic planning, headcount planning, and the overall planning and execution cadence of the organization.
2. **Office operations** - Manage human resources, talent acquisition, procurement and legal operations to support the organization's business objectives. This may also include being responsible for things like  diversity and culture initiatives, as well as contracts, vendor agreements, and purchase renewals that don't naturally fit into the other functions.
3. **Internal, external, and executive communications** - reporting for leadership reviews; organizing meeting agendas, all hands, and team off sites; preparing the CXO for conferences, events, interviews, and other engagements; preparing regular updates on activities; and managing the overall "front door" of the organization to the rest of the company.
   
### 2. Boundaryless engagement

One of the most powerful organizational "hacks" Chiefs of Staff enjoy is that their scope is both organization-wide and boundaryless. This allows the Chief to go to where the work is, regardless of organizational lines or corporate hierarchy. This often takes the form of escalation-driven initiative management, but also could involve initiatives important but not urgent, have no clear leader, or are otherwise are under resourced.

In this capacity, you can think you could think of the Chief of Staff as being the directly responsible individual (DRI) for "somebody should own this" -type projects, ambiguous and broad reaching problems that require "connecting the dots" to uncover possibilities, change management, and generally doing what needs to be done without regard for seniority or structure.

This role also takes the form of organizational "air traffic controller", in terms of helping the CXO prioritize projects; resolving disputes, ambiguity, or otherwise driving consensus; and serving as an honest broker by facilitating tough conversations and the decisions that naturally follow.

### 3. Portfolio management

In some ways, you can think of a Chief of Staff as staff or principle program manager, and for many (such as myself), that's a natural transition. As a Chief of Staff, Instead of managing a single program, you manage the CXO's portfolio of responsibilities. I've [written before](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/) about the ways program managers bring value to an organization, but there are a few I'd specifically call out as uniquely applicable to Chiefs:

* **[Communication, coordination, and facilitation](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#1-communication-coordination-and-facilitation)** - *Communicating* decisions and other key updates that may affect others, *coordinating* dependencies and other inter-related efforts across teams, and *facilitating* work by ensuring teams have the resources they need (unblocking).
* **[Reporting up and across](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#4-reporting-up-and-across)** - This often involves capturing and tracking work in flight, especially cross-functional initiative, as well as thoughtfully and regularly reporting up and across to ensure situational awareness at all levels.
* **[Identify, analyze, and mitigate risk](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#3-identify-analyze-and-mitigate-program-risk)** - In this sense, I think of the Chief of Staff being the one with their "hands inside of the organizational machine" to bring problem areas to light, drive successful execution, and enable teams to ship with speed and confidence.

### 4. Strategy, planning, and values

As a Chief of Staff transitions from the tactical to the strategic, they play an increasing role in shaping the organization's vision, N year plans, OKRs, and other far-reaching strategy documents. At the most basic level, that means working with other leaders to establish, document, and communicate planning materials and to drive the execution rhythm for teams to track progress against those strategic goals. 

More broadly, this aspect of the role is about helping the staff carry out the CXO's vision and strategic intent at all levels. You can think of this as where policy and politics come together. Once defined, the Chief of Staff is responsible for distilling and cascading the core tenant the organization's strategy to both internal and external stakeholders.

### 5. Advisor and confidant

As a healthy relationship develops between Chief of Staff and CXO, a more senior Chief begins to serve as a as trusted, strategic advisor and counsel to the CXO by acting as a sounding board and second set of eyes and ears.

* **Gatekeeper** - The Chief serves as a formal and informal gatekeeper to ensure that the CXO is spending their time on the right things that will allow them to have the greatest impact on the organization.
* **Leadership team effectiveness** - The chief manages the effectiveness of CXO's directs, including everything from meeting agendas to cadence and interpersonal dynamics
* **Ear to the ground** - The Chief can always be relied on to understand the pulse of the organization in a way the CXO will never be able to by establishing a "you can talk to me" reputation that invites honest dialog.[^3]
* **Deep understanding** - The Chief uses cross-functional knowledge to "scrub in" and deeply understand issues, trends, and perspectives that the CXO may not have the time to explore.

### 6. Relationship and brand management

Exceptional Chiefs of Staff offer transparency, predictability, consistency, and clarity to both those they work with and those the CXO work with to establish and grow stronger relationships and be seen as a critical partner. At its core, this is about avoiding surprises by managing expectations between the CXO, the CXO's peers, and other stakeholders. Beyond that, it's about ongoing relationship and brand management to enable the CXO's success by ultimately expanding their sphere of influence.


* Lead through persuasion and influence
* Know who to ask
* GSD reputation

[As a Program Manager](https://ben.balter.com/2021/03/26/nine-things-a-technical-program-manager-does/#5-relationship-management) and now as a Chief Of Staff, I see it is not only acceptable, but an expectation of the job to be able to hear the otherwise unstated.
