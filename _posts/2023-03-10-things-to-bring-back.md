title: Things to bring back
description:
---

I recently marked 10 years at GitHub. The company changed a lot since I joined a manager-less and idealistic organization of a little over 100 people. Growth, funding, scandal, loss of direction, acquisition, even more growth, and a pandemic - 21 re-orgs later, it's been a wild ride.

Here are N things from GitHub's earlier days, that I wish we could bring back at our scale today:

## Culture tools 

We used to have a concept called "culture tools" to describe how we crafted internal tooling. As the documentation then put it: "GitHubbers work differently than other people. It is important that our tools not only reflect this, but encourage it and support it." Culture tools were more than just get-the-job-done internal tools, but brought the samae level of attention to detail, taste, and craftsmanship to internal products as we did our customer-facing ones. 

Their character was driven by the culture of GitHub and the way we work. The foundational mechanics of communication at GitHub (at the time) was URLs, @mentions, subscriptions, autocompletion, markdown, emoji, accessibility, simplicity, and BEAUTY. These weren't just features we wished our internal tools had. These were features we expected them to have. They were features that let us work the way we want to work - Asynchronously, whenever, wherever, on whatever - and let us jump from tool to tool, and things just worked the way you'd expect them to without any learning curve. 

These tools, at their core, helped us optimize for Hubber happiness. As the Culture Tools "Ethos" put it, "Actions required of a hubber that do not benefit the hubber == process. Don't do this. Ever... Work with hubbers, not against them. Features should fit the way hubbers already work."

* Being oppinionated about how we worked
* Talking about how we worked
* Shoutouts
* Leadership accountability
* Safety of being wrong
* Time to learn/tinker/hack
* Not shipping the org chart / quality / wholistic experience
* Speaking like a human 
* demo days
* Individual customer focus
* Memes and having fun
* Developer friction.
* Work being more important than the game of work
* Default to yes, vs default to letâ€™s talk
* Healthy debate good intentions

Things we did keep:

* developer happiness
* Output > input
*
