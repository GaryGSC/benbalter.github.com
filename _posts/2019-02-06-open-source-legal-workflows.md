Inspired by the post [15 rules for communicating at GitHub](https://ben.balter.com/2014/11/06/rules-of-communicating-at-github/) from a few years back, I spoke with Sam Glover from [the Lawyerist podcast](https://lawyerist.com/podcast-210-ben-balter/) on how lawyers can adopt the workflows, tools, and philosophies of open source to make their legal practice more remote-friendly.

To learn more about how GitHub uses GitHub for non-code things like legal and HR, [this Fast Company article](https://www.fastcompany.com/40430104/how-github-employees-use-github-for-projects-beyond-coding) is a great read.
