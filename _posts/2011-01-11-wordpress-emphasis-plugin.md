The New York Times [recently open-sourced](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/emphasis-update-and-source/){: data-proofer-ignore="true"} their nifty wizardry which allows users to highlight and link to specific text within an article or post. In their own words:

> Emphasis provides dynamic paragraph-specific anchor links and the ability to highlight text in a document, all of which is made available in the URL hash so it can be emailed, bookmarked, or shared.

I adapted the New York Time's implementation into a three-line WordPress plugin for my own site, and it is available in the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-emphasis/) as a one-click install, to add it to your own.

The "deep links" plugin allows for permalinking and highlighting of text on a paragraph and sentence level. No need to set anything up. Just install, tap shift twice, and start highlighting.
