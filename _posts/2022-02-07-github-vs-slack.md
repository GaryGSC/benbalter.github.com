title: GitHub vs Slack
description:

Throughout GitHub lore, we have phrases like "everything should have a URL", "if it doesn't have a URL, it didn't happen", or my personal favorite ["if you liked it then you should have put a URL on it"](https://ben.balter.com/2014/10/07/expose-process-through-urls/). While catchy, these bumper stickers fail to fully capture the underlying intention: As one Hubber succinctly wrote a number of years ago, "we write things down".

### Not all URLs are created equally

* Durability / longevity
* Discoverability (organization, cross linking, search)
* Fidelity
* Recorded stream of conscience vs. distilled thoughts
* Ability to indicate state

### Allow readers to opt-in to additional context

* Here's the decision
* Showing the work
* Play-by-play coverage

### Be purposeful about the tools you choose


> Just as blacksmiths know the value of an anvil, and bakers the value of yeast, so too must knowledge workers embrace the tools of their craft. A composer would never stand for his or her concerto being played on a kazoo. Why then, is content all-too-often created haphazardly, with its presentation and preservation being subject to the whims of organizational habit?
