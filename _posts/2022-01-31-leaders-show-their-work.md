title: Leaders show their work

A number of years ago, I opined on the value of memorializing decisions through URLs. [As I wrote then](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/):

> [URLs] provides a single, incontrovertible source of truth for the organization’s intentions, and equally important, exposes the reasoning behind the decision, reducing the tendency for top-down decisions to be communicated as “because I said so”.

That’s still true today, but there’s some critical nuance missing: for an organization to reap [those benefits](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/#the-value-of-giving-concepts-urls), its leaders must not merely *communicate* decisions in writing, but rather, must [adopt systems that naturally capture and expose process](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/#systems-that-naturally-capture-and-expose-process), and absent those systems, leaders - regardless of title or rank - must hold one another accountable for showing their work.

### Collaboration is an O(n<sup>2</sup>) problem

If you're working solo, you enjoy the benefits of absolute transparency and absolute efficiency. You know everything you know, and there's no added cost for sharing that information with yourself. As the number of people solving a problem grows, guarantees of both transparency and efficiency become exponentially more expensive. A small team may experience minor communication costs in terms of meetings and standups, for example, but as teams and companies grow, the burden of that communication layer adds up, rendering absolute participation in decision-making practically impossible.

Imagine the different challenges you might face in writing a birthday card collaboratively with a close friend, within a small startup, and within a large corporation. As the number of collaborators grow, there's an inherent trade-off between transparency and efficiency. 


### 

I admit, as GitHub has grown, I’ve fallen astray and am guilty of starting a Slack DM, Google Doc, or Zoom chat, tempted by the siren song of near-term efficiency that interrupt-driven work offers. 


Synchronous and asynchronous work each comes with their advantages and disadvantages. Just as the absence of work happy hours or serendipitous break room interactions require remote workers to take the affirmative step to get to know their coworkers on a human level, so too does 

### How

* Not just what, but why
* Show alternatives evaluated and why they weren’t right
* Socialize how decisions should be made
* Resolve ambiguity for those implementing
*
