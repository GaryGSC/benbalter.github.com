title: Leaders show their work
description:

TL;DR: You can either work in naturally transparent systems, or you have to commit to being transparent after the fact.

A number of years ago, I opined on the value of memorializing decisions through URLs. [As I wrote then](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/):

> [URLs] provides a single, incontrovertible source of truth for the organization’s intentions, and equally important, exposes the reasoning behind the decision, reducing the tendency for top-down decisions to be communicated as “because I said so”.

That’s still true today, but there’s some critical nuance missing from that excerpt: for an organization to reap [those benefits](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/#the-value-of-giving-concepts-urls), its leaders must not only communicate in writing *what* decisions were made, but must also explain *why* the decision was made and *how*.

There are two ways to do that: [adopt systems that naturally capture and expose process](https://ben.balter.com/2015/11/12/why-urls/#systems-that-naturally-capture-and-expose-process), or absent those systems, leaders must hold one another accountable for spending the necessary cycles to *show their work*.

### 

As teams scale, traditional approaches force a tradeoff between transparency and efficiency:

If you're working solo, you enjoy the benefits of absolute transparency and absolute efficiency. You know everything you know, and there's no added cost for sharing that information with yourself. As the number of people solving a problem grows, guarantees of both transparency and efficiency often become exponentially more expensive. A small team may experience minor communication costs in terms of say weekly meetings and daily standups, but as teams and companies grow, the cost of traversing that network layer adds up, rendering absolute participation in decision-making practically impossible.

Traditionally this challenge of scale is solved by introducing [a management abstraction layer](https://ben.balter.com/2012/12/16/deprecate-management/) which coordinates across business units via more opaque and synchronous processes and then communicates out decisions to the rest of the company.

### Collaboration doesn't have to be an O(n<sup>2</sup>) problem

I admit, as GitHub has grown, I’ve fallen astray and am guilty of starting a Slack DM, Google Doc, or Zoom meeting, tempted by the siren song of near-term efficiency that interrupt-driven work offers. 

Synchronous and asynchronous work each comes with their advantages and disadvantages. Just as the absence of work happy hours or serendipitous break room interactions require remote workers to take the affirmative step to get to know their coworkers on a human level, similarly the absence of organic transparency requires managers to take the affirmative step to expose process to their team.

### How

* Not just what, but how, and why
* Show alternatives evaluated and why they weren’t right
* Socialize how decisions should be made
* Resolve ambiguity for those implementing
*
